1) Constructor is special method it is used to initialise the object
* The main pursose of constuctor to initialise the object
* Very class as a constuctor 
* In constuctor there is no return type including VOID

* There are two types of constuctor they are:-
*Defolut constuctor
*parameterise constuctor

1)Defalut constuctor:-is constructor created by compiler
if we do not define any class 

2)parameterise constuctor:- programer written a class having one or more arguments


2)Features of java:-
*java is simple
*java is plateformindence
*java is secured
*java is object orintal programming language
*java is robust
*java is multitreated


*JAVA IS SIMPLE:- language
*java is east learn 
*java is east understand

*JAVA IS PLATEFORMINDEPENCE:-
*java right once run any way
*java can write in any flateform

*JAVA IS OBJECT ORINTAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:-
java is concept of object used to commicate with computerOrsystem

*JAVA IS ROBUST:-
*java has strong momory location
*java is strong

4)JDK
*JRE
*JVM

*JDK:-java develepment kite CONVERT java file to class 
*JRE:-java runtime envirolment it has strong memory laction
*JVM:-java virtual machine help give out put


6)about METHODS
METHODS it is group of code take input from user and process it and give output

why we method means:-define once and run muttiple object

7)METHODS OVERLOADING WITH EXAMPLE
METHOD OVERLOADING having same method but different parameters

example:-method("Kiran",126,695686567);
         method(234,"Owner",4574);
		 method (112,"Jain" true 'J');
Rules:-
*Number of paremeter
*Different dataytpes
*Order of parameter
		 
		 
8)DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONSTRUCTOR AND METHOD

CONSTRUCTOR:-it initialise the object 
*it is special method
*constructor chaing has two keyword
 1)this keyword :-refer the multiple object in constructor
 2)super keyword:-refer the object of super class 
 *They is no return type including void 
METHOD :-it takes input and process it and give out put to user
*It has return type
*method name same as class name


STATIC MEANS its common thing and non access specifier
9)STATIC VARIABLE:-A varible declared in static  know STATIC VARIABLE

*STATIC METHOD:-STATIC METHOD means with creating object

*STATIC BLOCK:-initialise static variables


5) MEMORY AREA ALLOCATED BY JVM IS
 *Jvm load class in class loader
 *Jvm look for a main method
 *It create stock and stock frame and heap also created in heap having constatnt pool Or string pool in down instatnce pool 
 *In stack created in stack frame they store *name of method *all variables *excution lines
 *It next mathod again create stack frame same process
 *Excution done complety the perticular fram is deleded
 *Next main also get deleted
 *Stack also deleted 
AND its creating new object  This is memory located by JVM


3)C++ AND JAVA

JAVA:-java is interpreted programming languge *INTERPRETED worked as small virtual system
JAVA:-java has its own plateform
JAVA:-invented by "GAMES GOSLING" in 1995 the team called "GREEN TEAM" company called "ORACLE"
JAVA :-object orintal programer language
JAVA:-its high leval langage

C++:-it is object orital programming language
*It has multiple plateform
*C++ easy to learn


10)CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING:-use more than one constructor in instance class this know as constructor overloading
